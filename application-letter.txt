Hello Dear sir, I am writing you an application letter to get a job in your company. Geoscan company(https://www.geoscan.aero/ru) is very big and cohesive I would like to be in your team. I really like the projects created by your team and I would like to create the same useful and highly intelligent things. I really like your works such as: geoscan garmin, geoscan 201 and others. I just graduated from university and therefore still have little experience in this scope, so I would like to have a salary of 30-50 thousand rubles. But still, I think I would be useful to your company, because I have some knowledge on this topic. I would like to work as a programmer or engineer in your company, I am very interested in this field of activity and I would like to develop in it. Your company is located in St. Petersburg, but I live in Dolgoprudny, so I would like to work remotely, but if necessary, I can come to your city.
Yours faithfully, Bunakov Egor.
